# CodePulse

## Description

A simple blog where a user can be logged in as an admin to add and edit categories and blog posts, users who aren't logged in can only interact with the blog posts by opening them from the main page and reading them.

More accounts can be added as admins so that multiple people can create and edit categories and blog posts, only admins can create new admin accounts so that they can edit and upload posts and categories!

Admin account created by me for everyone who wants to check out adding and creating blog posts and categories: 

-username: admin1@codepulse.com
-Password: Admin1@123

## Main page

The site's main page has all the blog posts displayed that I added, the blog posts can be opened and read from here, the nav bar is also present on this and every other page where the user has the option to log in!

## Categories

The admin can add and edit categories and also tag them on blog posts, editing and creating categories is pretty straightforward:
- The admin navigates to the nav bar
- Click the dropdown button
- Click on categories
- After the admin gets redirected to the table with all of the categories the user can choose to either edit or upload a category
- After clicking any of the two buttons the user has to fill in information for the category, such as the name and the URL
- Click on submit and it's complete


## Blog posts
